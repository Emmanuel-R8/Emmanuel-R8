Welcome ----

I work at the intersection of **software engineering**, **data / machine learning**, and **quantitative problem‑solving**. Many of my projects come from curiosity about how things work (markets, systems, languages) and a preference for building working prototypes rather than just reading about them.

## What you’ll find here

A mix of:

- **Machine learning & statistics**
  - Time series forecasting with transformers and deep learning
  - Classical ML / data science projects (e.g. scoring, recommender systems)
  - Experiments with modern tooling in Python, Julia and R

- **Programming languages & systems**
  - Some Lisp Machine emulation
  - Small tools, templates and experiments in various languages

- **Learning, notes & talks**
  - Course work and notes
  - Slides and code from meetups and presentations

Some repositories are exploratory or educational, others are closer to production‑style prototypes.

## Technologies I like to use

- **Languages**: Python, Julia, R, Rust, C/C++, Java, TypeScript  
- **ML / data**: PyTorch, scikit‑learn, statistical modeling, time series, optimisation  
- **Tools**: Git, Linux, Jupyter, Docker, SQL

Always combining solid mathematical reasoning with practical engineering, whether that’s for data‑driven projects or systems programming.

## How I approach projects

- Start from a clear question or use case  
- Keep the first version simple and measurable  
- Iterate and refactor toward clarity and robustness  
- Document enough for future‑me (and others) to understand what’s going on
